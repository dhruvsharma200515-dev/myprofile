          I’m <strong>Dhruv Parvesh Sharma</strong>, a TYBCOM student at Thakur College of Science & Commerce with a passion for
          business and entrepreneurship. I love exploring new ideas and continuously learning through reading.
          I’m also a sports enthusiast, particularly enjoying skating and football, which teach me teamwork and
          discipline. I’m eager to connect with like-minded professionals and peers to grow together.
